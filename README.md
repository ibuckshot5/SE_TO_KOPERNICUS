# SE_TO_KOPERNICUS
Converts Space Engine .sc code to Kopernicus .config code. Easy to use.

Runs on Windows

A very flexible code converter, also very WIP.

THE CODE WILL NOT BE CODE READY. YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED TO MAKE SOME MINOR EDITS

At the moment can only convert desert planets, because I'm lazy.
